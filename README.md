# Dataverse Exporters
A collection of community-developed metadata exporters that conform to the [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) exporter service provider interface (SPI) (1.0.0 first released with Dataverse 5.14, 2.0.0 released with Dataverse v6.0).

Documentation of the exporter SPI is available under [Advanced Installation](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/advanced.html) and [Metadata Export](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/metadataexport.html).

As discussed in the guides you can download an example (for Dataverse 6.0+): [MyJSON exporter jar](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-exporters/raw/main/prebuilt-examples/dataverse-spi-export-examples-2.0.0.jar).

Some exporters have a dedicated git repo:

Community members are encouraged to contribute to the documentation, add crosslinks, and create additional exporters.
